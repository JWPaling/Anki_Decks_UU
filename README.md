Keep in mind that Anki is a _space repetition_ technique. Thus, you should **first** understand a topic or specific relations in order to effectively study with the decks.

<h2> Updating </h2>

<body>
To update decks without losing personal notes added to cards, download the addon 'Special Fields': 1102281552. This addon gives you the option to protect fields from updating.

<h2> What about AnkiCollab?</h2>
<body>
AnkiCollab is a novel add-on with great potential to become a must-have. However, the current version of AnkiCollab has bugs that significantly impact the stability of decks. Therefore, decks must be manually updated via the Github repository. This process may require extra steps, but it ensures the stability of the decks.
