<h2> What about AnkiCollab?</h2>
<body>
AnkiCollab is a novel add-on with great potential to become a must-have. However, the current version of AnkiCollab has bugs that significantly impact the stability of decks. Therefore, decks must be manually updated via the Github repository. This process may require extra steps, but it ensures the stability of the decks.
