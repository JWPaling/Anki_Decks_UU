# Anki_Decks_UU
In this repository you will find Anki decks that are made by hand for different courses that are provide by Utrecht University, especially for Psychology. Feel free to use them, and comment if there is anything you might consider incorrect, disturbing, or difficult to understand

Each week I will try to keep up with the current course time table. 

CAUTION:
Be aware that these decks are handmade, and that some information can be wrong, outdated, or misplaced. Therefore, mention any errors you think are apparent in the decks.

Keep in mind that Anki is a _space repetition_ technique. Thus, you should **first** understand a topic or specific relations in order to effectively study with the decks.

<h2> Updating </h2>

<body>
To update decks without losing personal notes added to cards, download the addon 'Special Fields': 1102281552. This addon gives you the option to protect fields from updating.

<h3> Updating process </h3>
